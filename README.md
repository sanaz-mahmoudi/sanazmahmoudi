# Jupyter Notebooks by Sanaz Mahmoudi
In this repository, a network (shown in the figure below) comprising three buses interconnected via 100 MW transmission lines is considered. A 250 MW thermal power plant with a marginal cost of Â£50/MWh is connected to bus 1. A 150 MW wind farm with zero marginal cost is connected to bus 2; it is paired with a 100 MW sulphur-flow battery that provides 24-hour backup capability (i.e., the battery can operate at its rated capacity for 24 hours). All domestic and commercial consumers, with a peak electricity demand of 100 MW in February under normal weather conditions, are connected to bus 3. The power factor at bus 3 is assumed to be unity. Hourly profiles for normalised electricity consumption and renewable generation in February 2025 are provided ([link](https://github.com/sanaz-mahmoudi/sanazmahmoudi/blob/main/Hourly%20Profiles.csv)).

It is expected that a Dunkelflaute event will occur during the second week of February 2025, resulting in a 40% increase in electricity consumption and a 60% reduction in maximum available renewable production compared to the original profiles. In this regard, this repository includes some Jupyter notebooks presenting:

1. Optimisation example under normal conditions ([link](https://github.com/sanaz-mahmoudi/sanazmahmoudi/blob/main/OperationUnderNormalConditions.ipynb))
2. Optimisation example under abnormal conditions ([link](https://github.com/sanaz-mahmoudi/sanazmahmoudi/blob/main/OperationUnderAbnormalConditions.ipynb))
3. Resiliency assessment in a planned and unplanned 24-hour outage of the thermal power plant during the Dunkelflaute event ([link](https://github.com/sanaz-mahmoudi/sanazmahmoudi/blob/main/OperationUnderAbnormalConditionsDuringanOutage.ipynb))

Note: For the sake of simplicity, the transport model is used instead of AC or DC power flow equations to ensure nodal power balance.
